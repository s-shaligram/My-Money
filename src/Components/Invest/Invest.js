        A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors and
        invests the money in securities such as stocks, bonds, and short-term
        debt.

      <Text style={styles.title}>Share Market</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        The share market is a platform where buyers and sellers come together to
        trade on publicly listed shares during specific hours of the day.

      <Text style={styles.title}>Real Estate</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        One advantage of real estate investing is that it can provide
        diversification in an investment portfolio. Real estate investments
        often have a low correlation with other asset classes such as stocks and
        bonds, meaning that they can help spread risk and potentially reduce
        volatility.

      <Text style={styles.title}>Gold and Silver</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        Gold and silver also have the potential to appreciate in value over
        time, providing a source of long-term wealth building. However, their
        value can also fluctuate due to changes in the economy, interest rates,
        and market demand.
